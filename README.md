# Prostrate-cancer-perdiction-using-knn
exploring knn

The Dataset can be found in the UCI repository mentioned in the below link
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

The aim is to accuratly predict the patient as either M = malignant, B = benign, based on variour features given in the dataset.
This case study uses KNN Algorithm to predict Prostrate Cancer.

There are 3 python files. KNN.ipynb, python notebook classifying a patitent as Maligent and Benign using KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier
KNN try1 shows the chioce of Optimal K value., along with #D visualization of data points
KNN Try3 shows the accuracy of KNN algorithm for varying/ different choices of K.

For all the algorithm, Accuracy is calculated. 
First file had confusion matrix, False / True Positives, False / True Negatives using which specificity and sensitivity are calculated.
